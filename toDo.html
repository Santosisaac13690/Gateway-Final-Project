          <p>The Roat치n Institute of Marine Sciences offers an unforgettable dolphin experience. Best of all, it takes place in a natural lagoon, where the dolphins are free to swim around in a large area like they do in the wild. Animal lovers can swim and snorkel with the dolphins, play games with them, or enjoy a dolphin dive experience. Budding marine biologists can also sign up for the "Dolphin Trainer for a Day" program and perform their own dolphin show for their proud parents at the end.</p>

          <p>At an altitude of 2,270 meters, this jungle preserves a lush cloud forest that is home to ocelots, pumas, and monkeys, although it's rare to see these larger mammals. This is one of the most visited parks in Honduras and offers a vision of how the area looked long before logging claimed much of the surrounding forests. The park is also a haven for more than 200 species of birds, including toucans, trogons, and the quetzal. Well-marked hiking trails wind through the thick forest, where bromeliads and orchids flourish.</p>
